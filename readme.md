# Google Ads Reporter

Google Ads Reporter is a command-line package that authenticates against the Google Ads API, executes curated GAQL queries, and presents the results in both **interactive console mode** and **direct CLI mode**.

---

## Features

* Built on Python 3.11+ with the official `google-ads` client library.
* Uses gRPC to communicate with the Google Ads API.
* Interactive menus for **performance, audit, and budgeting reports**.
* CLI arguments for automation (headless mode).
* Supports both **OAuth** and **Service Account** authentication.
* CSV/JSON export modes available.

---

## Report Types

The reporter supports multiple reporting scopes, each with its own options:

- **Performance Reports**  
  Break down campaign, ad group, and ad-level metrics. Supports toggles such as devices, channels, and campaign info.  

- **Audit Reports**  
  Provide diagnostic views of labels, campaign groups, and label assignments to help validate account hygiene and consistency.  

- **Budget Reports**  
  Summarize spend, pacing, and related KPIs across single or multiple accounts.

  
### Performance

- **ARC (Ad Response Code)**  
  A custom extension for deeper analysis.  
  - Embed a custom identifier in your campaign naming convention:  
    ```
    Campaign Name :ad_response_code
    ```
    Examples:
    - `Nike Shoes - Holiday Sales :nikeholidaysales`
    - `Chicago - Legal - FRG :chi_frg_legal`
    - `GoogleAdsCampaign: MyCampaign :my_ad_response_code`
  - Uses:
    - Audit UTM parameters against campaigns.  
    - Link Ads activity with ERP or CRM systems.  
    - Add a flexible reporting dimension for cross-channel analysis.  
  - If no `:ad_response_code` is present, the report will return `None`/blank.

---

- **Account**  
  High-level KPIs at the account level. Useful for executive summaries or quick health checks across accounts without drilling into campaign details.  

---

- **Ads**  
  Campaign, ad group, and ad-level performance reporting.  
  - Standard metrics: impressions, clicks, conversions, costs.  
  - Dimensions: device breakdowns, channel type, campaign metadata.  
  - Includes ARC values where available.  

---

- **GLCID / Click View**  
  Exposes **click-level data** tied to Google Click Identifiers (GCLID).  
  - Shows both valid and invalid clicks.  
  - **Limitations**:  
    - Must query a **single day**.  
    - Only available for data within the **last 90 days**.  
  - Use cases: validating click-level tracking, fraud auditing, and attribution analysis.  

---

- **Paid & Organic Search Terms (POSTV)**  
  Combines paid ads + organic results at the query level.  
  - Aggregated at **ad group scope**.  
  - Available metrics include:  
    - Paid CPC, organic clicks, combined impressions, query frequency.  
  - Ideal for identifying **keyword gaps** or measuring **incremental lift** when ads + organic overlap.  

---

### Auditing

- **Account Labels**  
  Fetches all labels assigned to the account for review.  
  - Does not return any associating campaigns, ad groups, or ads.  
  - Use cases: verifying naming conventions and label hygiene.  

---

- **Campaign Groups**  
  Returns the account's current campaign groups by name and ID.
  - Does not return any associating campaigns, ad groups, or ads.  
  - Use cases: confirming campaign group assignments, validating group-level strategy.  

---

- **Campaign and Ad Group Label Audit**  
  Obtains all campaign group and label designations for campaign and ad group scopes.  
  - Includes campaign/ad group details and applied labels.  
  - Use cases: checking compliance with internal naming/labeling standards, surfacing unlabeled assets.  

---

### Budgeting

- **Budget Overview**  
  Summarizes monthly budgets, current spend, and pacing.  
  - View across one or multiple accounts.  
  - Use cases: monitoring over/under-spend, pacing against plan, budget caps.  

---

- **Under Construction**  
  Future enhancements may include:  
  - Forecasting based on historical spend + seasonality.  
  - Budget vs performance efficiency scoring.  
  - Alerts for anomalies or pacing concerns.

## Installation

Clone the repository and set up a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jopeymonster/gar_proto.git
cd gar_proto
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also install it in **editable mode** for development:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This registers the package so you can run it anywhere with:

```bash
python -m gar
```

## Authentication

1. **Create or select a Google Cloud project.** Enable the Google Ads API.
2. **Choose authentication type:**

   * **OAuth client credentials**: client ID/secret + refresh token.

## Development & Contributing

1. **Branching strategy**

   * `codex`: agent-driven experiments
   * `develop`: integration before `main`
   * `main`: stable, tagged releases
   * `f01.x`: feature scratchpad branches
   * `issues`: critical bugfixes

2. **Workflow**

   * Work from feature branches (`f01.2`, etc.).
   * Submit PRs > `develop` > `main`.
   * `main` and `develop` are protected (no direct pushes).

3. **Before committing**

   ```bash
   ruff check .
   ruff format .
   pytest
   ```

4. **Pull Requests**

   * Include test coverage for new args/features.
   * Keep docstrings and CLI help updated.
